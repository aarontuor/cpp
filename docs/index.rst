About Safekit
=============
Safekit is a python software distribution for anomaly detection from multivariate streams,
developed for the AIMSAFE initiative at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
It should have a better name, so any suggestions are welcome.
The code of the toolkit is written in python using the tensorflow deep learning
toolkit and numpy.
The toolkit is comprised of four core modules and two supplementary packages.
In this introduction we will discuss each of these components.
